TIME SERIES DECOMPOSITION

```{r}

#We are going to learn to identify and analyze the components in a time series dataset

#We will start with the powerload dataset, which has quarterly data, meaning the frequency is 4. Note that data coll

PL = read.table("PowerLoad2.txt", sep="\t",header=T)
head(PL)

#we are using the powerload variable in the dataset, which is our response variable of the time series

#Let's first decompose the powerload time series and check the components. To begin, we must specify aspects of the time series to R, and create a timeseries variable using the TTR package's ts() function
require(TTR)
TSPL = ts(PL$PowerLoad, frequency = 4, start=c(2006, 1))
plot(TSPL, ylab = "PowerLoad", col = "purple")

#Observations: we see an increasing trend and peaks every 1st and 3rd quarter, as well as valleys in the 2nd and 4th quarters. We can also see the 3rd quarter is the maximum and 2nd is the minimum every year.
#Decomposing the time series
DecomTSPL = decompose(TSPL)
DecomTSPL
plot(DecomTSPL)

#In the above plot we can see the original time series (top / 1), extracted trend (2), extracted seasonal variation (3), and random residuals (bottom / 4)
#we can now see the increasing trend clearly. we can also clearly see the quarterly changes that we noted previously in detail

MOVING AVERAGES

MAhat = predict(MAmodel, newdata=data.frame(t=17:20))
MAhat

#step 3: Let's adjust for the corresponding seasonal index / 100

F17 = MAhat[1]*109.8036/100

EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING

#we are going to use "Exponential smoothing" into the PowerLoad dataset. We will be using an exponential smoothing constant of 0.7. We will use the function HoltWinters() for exponential smoothing, with only alpha = exponential smoothing constant, so we need to set beta=FALSE, gamma=FALSE

EXPL = HoltWinters(TSPL, alpha = 0.7, beta = FALSE, gamma = FALSE)

TIME SERIES REGRESSION

RegFt #these are the forecasted values for the 4 quarters of 2010

#as this is a  MLRM we cannot plot a line but we can plot the fitted values of the MLRM

#we are going to plot the fitted.values of the model on the original time series data
RegPL$fitted.values #note, these are fitted values, not forecasts
TSReg=ts(RegPL$fitted.values, frequency = 4, start=c(2006,1))
